## Who is PropSift For?

PropSift is designed for:

## Core Features

### 1. Lead Management (Records)

Store all your property leads in one organized database.

**What you can track:**
- Property address and details
- Owner name and contact info
- Multiple phone numbers per lead
- Custom tags and motivations
- Notes and activity history
- Current status and temperature

**How it helps:**
- No more spreadsheets or scattered data
- All information in one place
- Easy search and filtering
- Complete history of every interaction

---

### 2. Smart Scoring

PropSift automatically calculates a **priority score** for each lead based on:

| Factor | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Motivations** | Why they might sell (divorce, probate, tax liens, etc.) |
| **Data Quality** | How complete and accurate the information is |
| **Engagement** | Have they responded to previous contact? |
| **Recency** | When was the lead added or last contacted? |
| **Phone Status** | Do we have good phone numbers? |

**Score Ranges:**
- **90-100** → Call Now (highest priority)
- **50-89** → Call Queue (regular priority)
- **Below 50** → Nurture (lower priority)

This means you always know which leads deserve your attention first.

---

### 3. Temperature System

Leads are assigned a **temperature** that determines how aggressively to pursue them:

| Temperature | What It Means | Contact Frequency |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 🔥 **HOT** | High motivation, urgent | 7 calls over 14 days |
| 🌡️ **WARM** | Good potential | 5 calls over 21 days |
| ❄️ **COLD** | Lower priority | 3 calls over 45 days |
| 🧊 **ICE** | Minimal engagement | 2 calls over 60 days |

**Temperature changes based on:**
- Lead shows interest → Temperature goes UP
- Lead shows disinterest → Temperature goes DOWN
- No contact after multiple attempts → Auto-downgrade

---

### 4. DockInsight (Calling Dashboard)

Your command center for working through leads. DockInsight shows:

- **6 Buckets** - Leads organized by priority and status
- **Next Up Card** - Current lead with all details
- **Quick Actions** - Call, skip, snooze, log results
- **Stats Sidebar** - Track your daily activity

**The 6 Buckets:**

| Bucket | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| 📞 **Call Now** | Highest priority leads |
| 📋 **Follow Up** | Leads with tasks due |
| 📱 **Call Queue** | Regular leads to work |
| ✅ **Verify First** | Need data verification |
| 🔍 **Get Numbers** | Missing phone numbers |
| 🌱 **Nurture** | Long-term leads |

---

### 5. Lead Cadence Engine (LCE)

The brain behind PropSift's follow-up system. The LCE:

- **Schedules follow-ups** automatically based on temperature
- **Tracks call attempts** and advances through the cadence
- **Hides called leads** until their next scheduled date
- **Adjusts priority** based on call results and status changes

**How it works:**
1. You call a lead and log the result
2. LCE calculates when to call next
3. Lead disappears from your queue
4. Lead reappears on the scheduled date
5. Repeat until deal closes or lead exits

This ensures **persistent, systematic follow-up** without manual tracking.

---

### 6. Custom Statuses & Call Results

Customize PropSift to match your workflow:

**Statuses** - Track where each lead is in your pipeline:
- New Lead, Contacted, Follow Up
- Interested, Not Interested
- Under Contract, Sold, Dead, DNC

**Call Results** - Log what happened on each call:
- No Answer, Left Voicemail
- Answered, Busy
- Wrong Number, Disconnected
- DNC Requested

Each status and call result has **configurable behaviors** that tell the system how to handle the lead.

---

### 7. Team Collaboration

Work together with your team:

- **Shared leads** - Everyone sees the same data
- **Activity tracking** - See who did what and when
- **Role-based access** - Control who can do what
- **Team stats** - Track team performance

---

## How PropSift Works (The Big Picture)

```
Import Leads → Score & Prioritize → Work in DockInsight → Log Results → Auto-Schedule → Repeat
```

### Step 1: Import Your Leads
Upload your lead lists or add leads manually. PropSift organizes them automatically.

### Step 2: Leads Get Scored
The system analyzes each lead and assigns a priority score and temperature.

### Step 3: Work in DockInsight
Open DockInsight to see your prioritized queue. Start with "Call Now" leads.

### Step 4: Make Calls & Log Results
Call each lead, then log what happened (answered, no answer, wrong number, etc.)

### Step 5: System Schedules Follow-Up
Based on the result, PropSift schedules the next call and hides the lead until then.

### Step 6: Leads Reappear When Due
On the scheduled date, leads pop back into your queue ready to call again.

### Step 7: Repeat Until Closed
Continue the cycle until the lead becomes a deal, goes DNC, or is marked dead.
